    In this game you imagine an animal and the computer tries to guess it by asking you questions. The more the computer plays, the more the machine learns from you. The computer learns by adding nodes to a binary tree. You can view the growing binary tree
    by opening up the console and then pressing one of the "Tree Walk" buttons.  (Each button shows the tree in slightly different ways)
